- Do you have any questions for me:
  - Can you tell me about the team this role is part of.
  - What is the culture like in your organization.
  - What programming languages are most important for the products you develop
  - What types of opportunities for advancement are available within your company
  
- Where do you see yourself in five years:
  - My primary goal is to learn additional skills and grow with an organization.

- What are your strengths:
  - One of my strength is curiosity, it pushes me to learn new languages, technologies and look for things that are new
    or the things that intrigues me. This has helped me in getting recogition from my leaders in my current role.
  - Communication is also my strength, because in our field it is the most important thing. I don't hesitate to ask questions 
    when I don't understand something because I believe Communication is the one of the key to become successfull developer. 
  - I always carry a positive attitude because it improves outcomes. In my case if I fail to do something, it helps me in 
    thinking about the mistakes and then I work on those mistakes so that I don't repeat it again.

- What would you do if someone takes credit of your work:
  - I will speak with the person first and ask him to revise the information and include my name. If he doesn't agree or the 
    conversation isn't productive, I will consider including a team lead or manager to find a solution.

- How do you deal with conflict:
  -  Whenever I notice conflict, I will establish why it is happening, who it is with, and what steps can be taken to prevent it
     from escalating further.
  
- Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a co-worker:
  - A situation occured in my role where myself and a co-worker couldn't agree on the best way to develop a one feature
    We both had very different ways of seeing the problem but for the sake of team I decided to work on the logic suggested
    by him and I mentioned that we need to review the process and while testing it became clear that his approach was not solving
    certain problems then we reverted it back to my approach and since then the feature is working fine.

- How to deal with customers who complain about product or services:
  - I will talk to the customer and actively listen to the problem he is facing.
  - I will ask him some questions to better understand the problem or maybe in doing so I might figure out the root cause of the problem.
  - I will apologise to him and will tell him how I will help him with the problem. 
  - Also, I will try to find a good solution so that the issue doesn't arise again.
