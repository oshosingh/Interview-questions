- What are your strengths:
  - One of my strength is curiosity, it pushes me to learn new languages, technologies and look for things that are new
    or the things that intrigues me. This has helped me in getting recogition from my leaders in my current role.
  - Communication is also my strength, because in our field it is the most important thing. I don't hesitate to ask questions 
    when I don't understand something because I believe Communication is the one of the key to become successfull developer. 
  - I always carry a positive attitude because it improves outcomes. In my case if I fail to do something, it helps me in 
    thinking about the mistakes and then I work on those mistakes so that I don't repeat it again.

- What would you do if someone takes credit of your work:
  - I will speak with the person first and ask him to revise the information and include my name. If he doesn't agree or the 
    conversation isn't productive, I will consider including a team lead or manager to find a solution.
