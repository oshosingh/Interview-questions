- Why java is not 100% object oriented:
  - Because in java we have primitive datatypes such as boolean, int, float, double etc. 
  - Java provides wrapper for primitives but we can use primitives in their base form also.

- Why pointers are not used in java:
  - Since JVM is responsible for implicit memory allocation, thus in order to avoid direct access to memory
    by the user, pointers are discouraged in java.
  
- What is Jit Comiler in java:  
  - The bytes codes generated after compilation goes to JRE where interpreter and Jit compiler converts it To
    machine language. Since interpreter is slow, jit compiler optimizes the java code translation during runtime.

- Why string is immutable in java:
  - String Pool requires string to be immutable otherwise shared reference can be changed from anywhere.
  - security because string is the most used datatype, it is used in file system, networking, db connection etc,
    having immutable string allows you to be secure and safe because no one can change reference of string once it 
    gets created.

  - Note: Boolean is also immutable in Java

- What is marker Interface: 
  - A marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data member and functions. It is like a metadata for the 
    compiler to inform it what it has to do with the class which implements it.
    E.g., Serializable, cloneable
  
- Can you override a private or static method:
  - we cannot override private or static
  - private is not inherited.
  - static is not inherited because of method hiding.

- Does finally always execute:
  - Yes except below cases 
    System.exit(), system crash
  
- What methods does the object class have:
  - clone(), toString(), equals(), hashCode(), finalize()

- How can you make a class immutable:
  - Make class final
  - Make the data members private
  - Don't provide setter methods
  - return copy of fields during getter calls 
  - initialize all the fields via a constructor performing a deep copy

- What is singleton class and how can we make a class singleton:
  - check code

- Explain microservice architecture:
  - Breaking a project into smaller problems and developing and deploying them independently and enabling
    the communication between them to solve the big problem. You can use any tech stack for developing the 
    smaller problems.
  
- What are the challenges faced while using microservices:
  - Microservices always rely on each other. Therefore, they need to communicate with each other.
  - You need skilled professionals to support distributed microservices.

- What is restful:
  - Representational State transfer(Rest) web services is an architectural style that helps systems to communicate 
    over the internet. These web services make microservices easier to understand and implement. 
  
- What is meaning of OAuth:
  - Open authorization is a protocol that allows you to access the client app on http after being authenticated by 
    3rd party providers like Google, Facebook etc. 
  
- How independent micro-services communicate with each other:
  - It depends upon the project needs. However, in most cases, developers use HTTP/REST with JSON or Binary protocol.
    However, they can use any communication protocol.
  - Example of binary protocol is protobuf which is widely used for gRPC communication.

- How pagination works:
  - Pagination is used to show only the required data records instead of displaying or fetching all the data from db. 
    The logic is to divide the complete data into pages of fixed size and query the db for fetching only fixed size 
    record and dispaly them. It also makes db query very fast. 
  - The structure could be {currentPageNumber, [{dataRecordsList}], nextPage}
  - nextPage can be a boolean or a number which can tell us if nextPage is available or how many more pages are available
    excluding the current and previous pages.
