- Find second highest salary:
  - select max(salary) from Emp where salary < (select max(salary) from Emp)

- Find Nth highest salary:  
  - Using Dense rank method and apply distinct to return single result if duplicates are there  
  
    CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
    BEGIN
      RETURN (
          select distinct salary from (
            select salary, dense_rank() over (order by salary desc) as rs from Employee 
          ) 
          as sub_select where rs=N
      );
    END

- Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively (Table logs -> id, num): |
    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | id          | int     |
    | num         | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+
    id is the primary key for this table.
    id is an autoincrement column.
  
    ANS: select distinct a.num from logs a inner join logs b on a.id+1=b.id and a.num=b.num inner join logs c on a.id+2=b.id and a.num=c.num;
